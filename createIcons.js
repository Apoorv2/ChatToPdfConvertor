// Note: This is just a helper script to generate icons - not part of the extension
// You can run this in Node.js to generate icons, or create your own PNG files

// For simplicity, you can use any image editing tool to create 16x16, 48x48, and 128x128 PNG icons
// and name them icon16.png, icon48.png, and icon128.png respectively.
// Place them in an "images" folder in your extension directory.

// Alternatively, you can use online icon generators or find free icons to use.
